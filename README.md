# Thmanyah Project – Solution Summary

## Brief Explanation of the Solution

The project was built using **Kotlin** and **Jetpack Compose** with a **clean MVVM architecture** and follows **SOLID principles** for better scalability and maintainability. It is organized into **multiple modules** to enforce separation of concerns and support modular development and testing.

The solution focuses on displaying mixed content types—**podcasts**, **episodes**, **articles**, and **audiobooks**—within a unified, dynamic UI. A flexible and reusable `UIContent` data model was designed to represent all content types, which are then rendered using Compose based on their type and layout configuration.

For asynchronous and efficient data handling, **Kotlin Coroutines** and the **Paging 3 library** were used. Pagination allows smooth loading of large data sets without overloading memory or blocking the UI.

Dependency injection was implemented using **Hilt**, ensuring clean dependency management and ease of testing.

## Challenges and Difficulties Faced During Implementation

- Designing a unified data model to represent diverse content types while keeping the codebase clean and maintainable.
- Optimizing scroll performance and recomposition behavior in Jetpack Compose with large, mixed-type lists.
- Ensuring proper Hilt configuration across multi-module setup, especially in test environments.
- Managing dependencies and avoiding conflicts in a modularized Gradle setup.

## Ideas and Suggestions for Improvement or Alternative Approaches

- Consider using a stricter architecture pattern such as **MVI** for better state management and testability.
- Add caching mechanisms (e.g., Room + NetworkBoundResource) to improve performance and offline support.
- Leverage sealed classes and polymorphism to further streamline content handling.
- Improve UI responsiveness with **skeleton loaders** or **shimmer effects** while content is loading.
- Expand the test coverage with **MockK** and **custom Hilt test components** for deeper integration testing.
- Monitor performance regularly using **Android Profiler**, **LeakCanary**, and other profiling tools.
